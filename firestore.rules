/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Synced Preferences.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and app settings.
 * Each user can only access their own data, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/profile: Stores user profile information.  The `userId` in the path must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/settings: Stores user-specific app settings. The `userId` in the path must match the authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly segregated and accessible only to the owning user.
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's `id` field is enforced on creation and immutability is enforced on updates.
