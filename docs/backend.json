    "reasoning": "This design prioritizes authorization independence and simplifies security rules by denormalizing authorization data and segregating data based on access requirements.\n\n*   **User Profiles:** Stored under `/users/{userId}/profile/{profileId}`. This path-based ownership ensures that only the authenticated user can access their profile.\n*   **App Settings:** Stored under `/users/{userId}/settings/{settingsId}`. This path-based ownership ensures that only the authenticated user can access their settings.\n\nThis structure achieves Authorization Independence by avoiding `get()` calls in the security rules. Each user's profile and settings are directly accessible via their `userId`. This supports the QAPs by enabling secure `list` operations, as each collection only contains documents accessible to the specific user. Segregation is achieved by keeping user-specific data under their respective user ID paths."
